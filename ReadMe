Compose file to run Kafka and ZooKeeper containers:

bash

# Kafka and ZooKeeper Docker Compose

This Docker Compose configuration allows you to easily run Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper containers for local development or testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Docker website: [https://www.docker.com](https://www.docker.com)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/kafka-zookeeper-docker.git



2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd kafka-zookeeper-docker




3. Customize the configuration:

- Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in a text editor.
- Modify the environment variables as needed. For example, you can change the Kafka port or adjust the replication factor.
- Save the changes.

4. Start the containers:

docker-compose up -d




This command will download the required Docker images (if not already present) and start the Kafka and ZooKeeper containers in detached mode.

5. Verify the containers are running:

docker-compose ps




You should see the `kafka` and `zookeeper` containers listed with a "Up" status.

6. Access Kafka:

Kafka is now running on your local machine. You can connect to it using the configured host and port (e.g., `localhost:9092`).

7. Clean up:

To stop and remove the containers, run the following command:

docker-compose down




This will stop the containers and remove their associated resources.

## Customization

You can customize the Kafka and ZooKeeper configuration further by modifying the respective configuration files located in the `config` directory. Feel free to adjust the settings based on your specific requirements.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues while starting the containers, ensure that there are no conflicts with other services running on your local machine. Make sure the configured ports are available.
- Check the logs of the containers for any error messages:

docker-compose logs




- For more information on configuring Kafka and ZooKeeper, refer to the official Kafka documentation: [https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)
